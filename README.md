# BoostSV

BoostSV is a machine learning based tool to predict the quality of SV breakpoint by assessing the alignment quality at the breakpoint location. 
The model is trained on transmitted breakpoints from a four-generation pedigree ([David Porubsky et.al _Nature_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08922-2)) with both HiFi and ONT reads.
